We always ask "Did you eat breakfast, lunch or dinner?" The most famous word in China is "Food is god!" We like eatting what can make us happy!</h2>

They are Shandong cuisine, Sichuan cuisine, Cantonese cuisine, Su cuisine, Fujian cuisune, Zhejiang cuisine, Hunan cuisine and Anhui cuisine.<br></h4>
