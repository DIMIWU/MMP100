	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Chinese characters are one of the oldest characters in history, and they are still widely used in the world today. As far back as the fourteenth century BC, it was a fairly well-developed writing system. It had a long history before. On the earth, there are only a few types of characters that are earlier than Chinese characters. The most famous are the ancient Egyptian holy book characters and the cuneiform writings of the two river basins that were born in two other ancient cultural policy sources.
