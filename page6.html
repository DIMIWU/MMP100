	<h1>Concept</h1>
	<div class="main"> 
		<h3 style="text-align: center;">Since I came to the United States, I have felt a lot of cultural differences between China and the United States. Many Americans think Chinese are so quiet. However, do Chinese never like to express themselves? Of course not! In many cases, language ability and cultural habits limit us!</h3>

        <div class="right"><h2>Humble</h2>
            <h3>In our education, parents and teachers always tell us to be humble. Most Chinese parents rarely praise their children. Because they do not want to make children arrogant.</h3>
            <p>However, it does not adapt to American society sometime. We are used to say that we are not very good even though we work so hard. We would lost many oppotunities and good jobs.</p>
        </div>
    	<div class="left"><h2>Peaceful</h2>
            <h3>Chinese are peaceful. We do not like wars. And many people do not like arguing with others.</h3>
            <p>We are not cowardly, we just do not like trouble and arguing. We often say "Small things, samll things." But I have often heard some news about Chinese were robbed because some people did not call the police, they do not want to get more trouble. That's a big mistake!</p>

        <div class="right">
        	<h2>Relationship</h2>
        	<h3>Relationship is important for Chinese. We think good relationship could figure out many trouble.</h3>
            <p>Chinese would like to keep good relationship with others. And a lot of us think we need other when we need. However, Chinese think it is great than rules. It is totally wrong in America.</p>

            <h2>Euphemistic</h2>
            <h3>Chinese people are euphemistic. Parents always tell children speaking too straight is impolite. </h3>
            <p>Many Chinese do not show their mean straight. For example, my professor used to describe Chinese. He said if Chinese people are thirsty when we visit friend's home, we may not say "I want to drink water", we would say "Today is hot." It was funny, but it described correct for some people.</p>

        <h2>My Experience</h2>
<h4>
I am outspoken people, but I do not have good English ability. I want to tell every one what I think. I think many chinese are same as me. Give us some time, we would like tell you our ideas!</h4>
